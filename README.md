LaunchCode project utilizing JavaScript, JSON, as well as the principles of fetch and validation.

Built from starter code provided by LaunchCode.


Requirements were to create a Launch Checklist Form which would validate the input to see if requirements were met for launching. 
  + The FORM
    = validate responses with preventDefault() so that...
       + every input field was filled 
       + correct type of data (string vs. integers) entered in each input field
       + verify if "ready for launch" or not based on input
       + indicate good vs. bad input (use the DOM to update the CSS and change colors)
   + The JSON
     = fetch planetary JSON images and data, that user can scroll through via mouse clicks



Bouns mission, use the JSON to populate the appropriate input feilds.  TBD.
